My name is Xiaoyua Yang, and if you find it difficult to pronounce my name, you can call me Ian instead. I am currently a junior majoring in Physics at Wuhan University, China. I have been fascinated by Astronomy and Astrophysics since my time in middle school. I still remember watching "Interstellar" at least five times. Finally, I have stepped into the realm of Astronomy and Astrophysics, with the hope of delving deeper into the mysteries of the universe and making my own contributions to the field. I am a cat lover, although I don't currently have one. Additionally, I am a photographer (albeit not a very good one). I have a deep appreciation for various genres of music, including Hip-hop, Jazz, R&B, and more.
